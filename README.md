<a href="https://flourish-pro.netlify.app/">Flourish Plant Care App</a>
 </h4>
 <p> Flourish is a full stack React app implementing a GraphQL back end and two APIs for plant image recognition and plant care. Users are able to search for a plant by image recognition or name to find care instructions and tips. Through authentication users may set up a personal profile, save plants to their collection, and create personalized notes for their plant babies! 
</br>
</br>
I primarily worked on the Front End of this application and enjoyed learning about Front End fetches of GraphQL queries and mutations. We used state management to simplify our complex file structure, and our team remotely implemented an Agile system to stay on the same page. This was a wonderful experience, and I am looking forward to optimizing the Front End for mobile viewing. </p>

<h4>
<a href="https://mystechal-divinators.github.io/project-week-tarot-divinators/index.html">Major Arcana Divinator App</a>
</h4>
 <p> This app was primarily written with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with additional items created in PhotoShop and GarageBand. Users may choose a one or three-card Tarot spread, and a randomized reading is displayed. Past readings are stored in a history log using local storage.
 </br>
 </br>
I enjoyed working on all aspects of this app! I had fun learning how to implement sound effects, and recorded a few synth sounds on GarageBand that are activated within a card onClick function. I championed this project and enjoyed collaboratively working with this wonderful team! We used an Agile Kanban ticket system to remotely organize tasks, and were able to communicate well while staying on the same page. </p>

<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=not-bot.be-human&ssr=false#overview">beHuman VS Code Extension App</a>
</h4>
 <p> This app was created using with Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, Heroku, Netlify, and Photoshop. In 7 days my team and I created a VS Code extension that alerts users to take a break from their screens at a time increment of choice. The alerts offer quick wellness tips, and an optional external link to instructional stretching videos focusing on common tension areas associated with desk work. 
The extension has two parts, a user-facing portion linking the application’s functionality to the VS Code Extension Marketplace, and an admin access page that allows the development team to easily add and edit the data shared in the extension alerts. We developed our app with mob-programming, pair-programming, and individual programming using an organized ticket system, and had intentional check-ins twice per day allowing everyone's input to be heard.
</br>
</br>
My main development contributions to the user-facing side included creating user settings, commands, and shortcuts activating time functions, a reset-time function, a logo for our app, and publishing the application to the VS Code Marketplace.
</br>
</br>
My admin page contributions included fetch calls and functions allowing us to add, edit, and delete quick tips, fetch calls allowing us to invite a new admin by email, and adding to the quick tip data structure. This was my first time creating a VS Code extension and I learned many steps along the way. I am looking forward to creating more extensions in the future!
</br>
</br>
I had a wonderful time working with my teammates and experienced what it is like to remotely develop code in different time zones. I am looking forward to continued work with this team expanding the extension’s capabilities and data structure in the future.

<a href="https://karaoke-roulette.netlify.app/">Karaoke Roulette App</a>
</h4>
 <p> This React app was created using YouTube API, JavaScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, CSS, Heroku, Netlify, Postman, and Photoshop. 
 </br>
 </br>
Karaoke Roulette App uses the YouTube API, allowing users to select randomized karaoke songs to sing with friends. The user flow and design of this application allows participants to log in and save their favorite songs, and the user experience can be shared via video chat screen sharing for a safely social distanced karaoke party. I championed this project, and my main contributions included front-end design, user-flow, and implementing the API. Our team remotely used an Agile ticket system to collaborate and stay on task, and I enjoyed working with everyone involved! </p>
