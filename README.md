### Creative and innovative problem solver, empathetic team builder, optimist, and communicative collaborator.

### After several years working within the wellness and medical field I have migrated into Full Stack Software Engineering, and I'm loving it! With a broad skillset, adaptive resilience, and ability to find genuine connection in all places, I look forward to integrating a wholistic approach into the digital world.

### I have 20+ years experience in multi-instrumental music performance and composition, and 10+ years experience in event planning, touring, digital music production, digital photography, and editing. I enjoy incorporating these creative skills into my work whenever I can.

### I believe every business is made better with an inclusive and diverse array of perspectives and backgrounds. Do you agree?
