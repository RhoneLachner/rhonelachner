<a href="https://mystechal-divinators.github.io/project-week-tarot-divinators/index.html">Major Arcana Divinator App</a>
</h4>
 <p> This app was primarily written with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with additional items created in PhotoShop and GarageBand. Users may choose a one or three-card Tarot spread, and a randomized reading is displayed. Past readings are stored in a history log using local storage.

<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=not-bot.be-human&ssr=false#overview">beHuman VS Code Extension App</a>
</h4>
 <p> This app was created using with Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, Heroku, Netlify, and Photoshop. In 7 days my team and I created a VS Code extension that alerts users to take a break from their screens at a time increment of choice. The alerts offer quick wellness tips, and an optional external link to instructional stretching videos focusing on common tension areas associated with desk work. 
The extension has two parts, a user-facing portion linking the application’s functionality to the VS Code Extension Marketplace, and an admin access page that allows the development team to easily add and edit the data shared in the extension alerts. We developed our app with mob-programming, pair-programming, and individual programming using an organized ticket system, and had intentional check-ins twice per day allowing everyone's input to be heard.
