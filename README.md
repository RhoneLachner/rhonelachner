    <h3>2024 Development Portfolio Site</h3>
    <a href="https://www.rhonelachner.com/">Published Site</a> |
    <a href="https://github.com/RhoneLachner/2024-portfolio">Repository</a>
    <p>
      This portfolio site was built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to showcase my work as a developer and highlight my passion for clean, responsive design. Utilizing static site generation and optimized WebP images, the site ensures fast performance and a smooth user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used a component-based architecture, custom hooks, and state management to create an engaging user experience, while Tailwind CSS helped streamline the design process with scalable, efficient styling. Playwright was implemented to perform end-to-end testing, ensuring the contact form and email functionality work seamlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I invite you to explore my projects, and the source code is available on GitHub for those interested in a closer look!

 <h3> Boilerplate Wizard</h3>
    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~rhonezone">Published npm Packages</a> |
    <a href="https://github.com/RhoneLachner/boilerplate-wizard-monorepo">Repository</a>
  <p>
A collection of batteries‑included boilerplate generators for modern web apps published on npm. This project was created as a modern alternative to create-react-app to help developers scaffold production‑ready React and Next.js projects in seconds with strong defaults, a clean architectural foundation, and minimal configuration.

Each boilerplate UI contains an about page with user startup instructions and development commands. Wizard Note comments are embedded throughout the codebase to guide users on which files can be safely customized or removed.

Built using Node.js with native ES modules, Boilerplate Wizard powers multiple bp-wizard-create-* CLI tools, each designed to spin up a new project with sensible defaults, testing, linting, and modern structure. It integrates popular frontend frameworks like React 18 and Next.js 14 (App Router), and includes Vite for fast builds and modern development features. Code quality is enforced through ESLint and Prettier, and testing is fully configured with Vitest, Jest, and Playwright for unit, integration, and end-to-end coverage.

The project uses npm and pnpm workspaces for package management, and includes CI/CD support via GitHub Actions and Dependabot for automated updates and security. By emphasizing up-to-date dependencies and security-first practices, Boilerplate Wizard provides a robust starting point for professional-grade applications, personal projects, and hackathons.

<strong>Available Commands for npm Package Download:</strong></br> <strong>React + JavaScript: </strong> <code>npx bp-wizard-create-react-js my-app </code></br><strong>React + TypeScript: </strong> <code>npx bp-wizard-create-react-ts my-app</code></br><strong>Next.js + JavaScript: </strong> <code>npx bp-wizard-create-next-js my-app </code></br><strong>Next.js + TypeScript: </strong> <code>npx bp-wizard-create-next-ts my-app </code></br>

    <h3>beHuman VS Code Extension</h3>
    <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=not-bot.be-human&ssr=false#overview">VS Code Marketplace</a> |
    <a href="https://github.com/alchemy-be-human">Repository</a>
    <p>
      This app was created using Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, Heroku, Netlify, and Photoshop. In just 7 days, my team and I created a VS Code extension that alerts users to take a break from their screens at intervals of their choice. The alerts offer quick wellness tips, along with optional links to instructional stretching videos that focus on common tension areas associated with desk work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extension has two parts: a user-facing portion linking the application’s functionality to the VS Code Extension Marketplace, and an admin access page that allows the development team to easily add and edit the data shared in the extension alerts. We developed our app using mob-programming, pair-programming, and individual programming with an organized ticket system, and had intentional check-ins twice per day to ensure everyone’s input was heard.
