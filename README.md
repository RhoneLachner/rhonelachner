    <h3>2024 Development Portfolio Site</h3>
    <a href="https://www.sarahrhonelachner.dev/">Published Site</a> |
    <a href="https://github.com/RhoneLachner/2024-portfolio">Repository</a>
    <p>
      This portfolio site was built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to showcase my work as a developer and highlight my passion for clean, responsive design. Utilizing static site generation and optimized WebP images, the site ensures fast performance and a smooth user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used a component-based architecture, custom hooks, and state management to create an engaging user experience, while Tailwind CSS helped streamline the design process with scalable, efficient styling. Playwright was implemented to perform end-to-end testing, ensuring the contact form and email functionality work seamlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I invite you to explore my projects, and the source code is available on GitHub for those interested in a closer look!

    <h3>beHuman VS Code Extension</h3>
    <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=not-bot.be-human&ssr=false#overview">VS Code Marketplace</a> |
    <a href="https://github.com/alchemy-be-human">Repository</a>
    <p>
      This app was created using Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, Heroku, Netlify, and Photoshop. In just 7 days, my team and I created a VS Code extension that alerts users to take a break from their screens at intervals of their choice. The alerts offer quick wellness tips, along with optional links to instructional stretching videos that focus on common tension areas associated with desk work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extension has two parts: a user-facing portion linking the application’s functionality to the VS Code Extension Marketplace, and an admin access page that allows the development team to easily add and edit the data shared in the extension alerts. We developed our app using mob-programming, pair-programming, and individual programming with an organized ticket system, and had intentional check-ins twice per day to ensure everyone’s input was heard.
